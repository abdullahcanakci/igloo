I have one of those led strips which controlled with a colorful remote and shows you the rainbow. I like them, setting the mood up so I can spend time on dark themed environments, or not having to get up after I'm done for the night and want some sleep.
But I think they lack some of those IOT and modern electronics magic we get used to. I only have cheap ones, not those philips hue or some other brand. 
The ones I have, has 20 preconfigured color and 4 different seizure inducing modes, can alter brightness. Everthing is fine and dandy. But if you want to have another color, too bad. Want to turn your home something other than a disco, no mode for that.

In my mind perfect control device should have:
1. Can alter colors without any limit.
2. Can alter modes without any limit.
3. Set auto on-off setting.
4. Can controlled from old school remotes.
5. Integration.

## 1 - Coloring

It just PWM how hard can it be. 

Right now I'm leaning into 3 color channels + 1 common channel. From my market search most of these strips are common VCC and RGB, there are some RGBW but not really widespread, at least in my country.

## 2 - Modes

The ones I have seen have

- Strobe
- Fade
- Ones above but with different colors.

I think these are not really nice modes, fade is somewhat bearable. Having ability to change fade colors, times and looping would be great, one can achieve so much with mere settings. 

## 3 - Auto

Automatic off would be nice set a timeout and let it fade out, or set a timer and wake up to fake sunset in the middle of winter.

## 4 - Remote

Although having a network connection is great we can't be certain a networked device would be avaible for, this reason there should be sane defaults, and ability to set any random IR remote as remote would be great. 

## 5 - Integration

I can write anything that needed to make this work. But having and IOT device means integration. I have look into some opensource Home automation projects and there are plenty options to select. Tasmota looks promising but should wait and analyze.
